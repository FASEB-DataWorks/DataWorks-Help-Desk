The DataWorks! Help Desk brings together existing data sharing and re-use resources in partnership with societies and institutions to provide a human touch to help researchers through rough spots. It is predicated on the idea that most researchers want to share their data but do not have the resources or know-how to do so. THe HelpDesk will be fueled by DataWorks! Fellows, who will identify partner, and help to collect, adapt, and annotate content for an open knowledgebase of data re-use practices and policies.  Fellows will also support a chat-based peer mentoring service. *Planned launch in 2022.*
