# Wayfinding

The DataWorks! Help Desk brings together existing data sharing and reuse resources in partnership with societies and institutions to provide a human touch to help researchers through rough spots. It is predicated on the idea that most researchers want to share their data but do not have the resources or know-how to do so. The Help Desk will be fueled by DataWorks! Fellows, who will identify partners, and help to collect, adapt, and annotate content for an open knowledgebase of data reuse practices and policies.  Fellows will also support a chat-based peer mentoring service. *Planned launch in 2022.*

# Join the Conversation!

FASEB is a recent entry into the data sharing and reuse ecosystem, and as such we seek to learn and partner with organizations and initiatives already in this space.  FASEB DataWorks! activities can build bridges, augment and amplify resources for adoption and use by researchers in the biological and biomedical communities -- and beyond.  We are currently seeking partners for curriculum development, ongoing professional development opportunities, and funding for the Capacity Program and the Catalyst Prize.
