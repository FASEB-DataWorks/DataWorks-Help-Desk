# Wayfinding

The DataWorks! Help Desk brings together existing data sharing and re-use resources in partnership with societies and institutions to provide a human touch to help researchers through rough spots. It is predicated on the idea that most researchers want to share their data but do not have the resources or know-how to do so. THe HelpDesk will be fueled by DataWorks! Fellows, who will identify partner, and help to collect, adapt, and annotate content for an open knowledgebase of data re-use practices and policies.  Fellows will also support a chat-based peer mentoring service. *Planned launch in 2022.*

# Join the Conversation!

FASEB is a recent entry into the data sharing and re-use ecosystem, and as such  we seek to learn and partner with organizations and initiatives already in this space.  FASEB DataWorks! activities can build bridges, augment and amplify resources for adoption and use by researchers in the biological and biomedical communities -- and beyond.  We are currently seeking partners for curriculum development, ongoing professional development opportunities, and funding for the Capacity Program and the Catalyzing Data Re-Use Prize.
